# WholesomeBot

Wholesome Bot was a bot created for the Discord Hack Week. The bot is a small collection of commands to increase positivity within a discord. While it's not as fleshed out as we wanted it to be, we weren't able to get started on it until later in the week. However the current commands are:

!help - Lists the commands below.
!water - gives a fact about water and how it's good for you.
!encourage - Pulls from a list of over 50 quotes/sayings to encourage you.
!drank - Tell the bot what you drank and it will react to you.
The bot also has a few other features listed in the !help menu.
